*Motivation*: Payment by results is a relatively new way of giving development aid, where a recipient's performance against pre‐agreed measures determines the amount of aid they receive. It has proved popular, with most bilateral aid donors having at least experimented with the mechanism and the variety of measures stretching from individual health workers being paid for each procedure, to national governments being paid for students’ test scores.

*Purpose*: Given a lack of robust and systematic investigations of the effects of PbR, the paper uses the leading theoretical framework to synthesise the available evidence, asking whether payment by results works as intended. This allows a test of the framework and the evidence against each other.

*Approach*: I synthesise the evidence from eight projects fully or partially funded by DFID, the recognised world leader on PbR. This represents the best evidence currently available, and is critically analysed using the leading theoretical framework that breaks each agreement into its constituent parts.

*Findings*: I find no evidence that PbR leads to fundamentally more innovation or autonomy, with the overall range of success and failure broadly similar to other aid projects. This may partly be due to the current use of Payment by Results, with no readily identifiable examples of projects that truly meet the idealised PbR designs. Advocates of PbR may conclude the idea is yet to be tested. I argue PbR does not deal with the fundamental constraints that donors face, and so it is unsurprising that PbR is subject to the normal pressures that affect all aid spending.

*Policy Implications*: Donors would be sensible to limit themselves to either ‘small PbR’ (where the costs of PbR are minimised) or genuine ‘big PbR’ (where projects seek to maximise PBR's benefits). The current evidence shows that projects outside these two categories are worse than traditional forms of aid. Evidence for ‘small PbR’ is mixed, while there is no evidence for ‘big PbR’ as it has yet to be tried.
