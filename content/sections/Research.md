## **Research Interests**

My research focuses on designing adaptive approaches with strong theoretical and practical performance guarantees for sequential and data-driven decision-making processes. Motivated by complex and unexplored real-world problems, I mostly use machinery from statistics, machine learning, and optimization methodologies.
