# Biography

I'm associate professor in Development Economics at the University of East Anglia, in the School of International Development. I finished my PhD in 2010 at the Univeristy of Nottingham, focusing on development aid. I now mainly do behavioural and experimental economics, often with [The Field Lab Uganda](https://thefieldlabuganda.com/).
