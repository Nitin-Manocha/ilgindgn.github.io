    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract: Multilingualism is the global norm, but the implications of this for cooperation and public goods provision have not been studied before. We test whether the language in which a public goods game is played affects subjects&rsquo; contributions amongst a bilingual population in eastern Uganda, finding that subjects contribute 30% more on average in the national language. This treatment effect is solely driven by those most associated with the local Gisu identity, for whom contributions are 43-74% higher in the national language.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract: Payment by Results (PbR), where aid is disbursed conditional upon progress against a pre-agreed measure, is becoming increasingly important for various donors. There are great hopes that this innovative instrument will focus attention on ultimate outcomes and lead to greater aid effectiveness by passing the delivery risk on to recipients. However, there is very little related empirical evidence, and previous attempts to place it on a sure conceptual footing are rare and incomplete.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract: There are influential studies that argue that foreign aid displaces domestic tax revenue when it is given in the form of grants. These claims are based on data that are deeply problematic: several different sources are amalgamated into one dataset, with no apparent checks on compatibility. In this article, a variety of econometric strategies are used to overcome these issues of data quality. The resulting weight of evidence points to a modest but positive effect on the part of foreign aid generally on domestic tax revenue.

    <h2><a href="https://paulclist.github.io/publication/aid-index/">Do Performance Measures of Donors’ Aid Allocation Underperform?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract: Indices of donor performance abound. Their recent popularity has occurred within the context of pessimism over aid&rsquo;s impact and optimism over the effect of changes in donor behaviour. Rankings of donor allocative performance aim to change donor behaviour, either through direct pressure on governments or indirectly through public engagement. The indices themselves rely on descriptive measures, and typically claim methodological superiority over positive alternatives due to their simplicity. However, there are two problems.

    <h2><a href="https://paulclist.github.io/publication/aid-modality/">Selectivity on Aid Modality: Determinants of Budget Support from Multilateral Donors</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract: Since the late 1990s a selection on policy approach to aid was advocated such that more aid should be allocated to countries with good policies, but there is little evidence that this has occurred. This paper argues that donors may exercise selectivity over the aid modality. Specifically, multilateral donors will cede more recipient control over aid by granting more budget support to those recipients with better expenditure systems and spending preferences (towards the poor) aligned with the donor.

    <h2><a href="https://paulclist.github.io/publication/aid-allocation/">25 Years of Aid Allocation Practice: Whither Selectivity?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The 4P framework (Poverty, Population, Policy, and Proximity) is introduced as a way of understanding a donor&rsquo;s aid allocation. We use the two-part model and examine the period 1982-2006. The results indicate that recent conclusions of increasing selectivity are misplaced for the seven major donors analyzed, who together represent the majority of development aid. Indeed, the effect of each of the commonly mentioned time-trends (selectivity, the end of the Cold War, and the commencement of the Global War on Terror) is much smaller than the role of donor heterogeneity, which appears sizeable and entrenched.

    <h2><a href="https://paulclist.github.io/publication/aid-tax/">Aid and tax revenue: Signs of a positive effect since the 1980s</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract: This paper addresses the effect of aid loans and grants on tax effort using data for 82 developing countries over 1970–2005. We find no robust evidence for a negative effect of aid (grants or loans) on the tax/GDP ratio, other than a contemporaneous correlation, but find some evidence that the effect of grants on tax revenue is positive (if significant) since the mid 1980s and that grants tend to increase tax revenue over the medium term.
